    <p>For a long time, the role of a graphic designer was rather easy to define. It meant working with your hands to find the right visual form for a piece of content, and delivery of a final, static design e.g. in the form of a poster, business card or letterhead. Amazingly clever and beautiful art has been created this way.</p>
    <p>However, we find ourselves at an interesting time in the design world, not because this definition of design has changed much, but because the products we're required to build have changed. Looking at the media landscape of today, it's hard to find a design product that hasn't changed because of the digital revolution. Designing layouts for a smartphone app means taking into account a complex set of states, where each screen can have tens or hundreds of possible transitions. Designing the scenery of most computer games forces the designer to use procedural techniques, as it's simply impossible to design every detail by hand. Even logos are becoming dynamic, with designers building dynamic identities fit for representing many faces of the same entity. Common to all of these examples is that none of them can be built using traditional design tools, and all of them require the use of a programming language.</p>
