        <p>Have you wondered how speakers really work? Would you like to modify your old amplifiers to create a unique sound? Are you ready to create a new instrument that's uniquely yours?</p>

        <p>Take a look inside, speakers, amplifiers, oscillators, and sequences. Learn how these electronics really work and how to create a sound that's uniquely yours. This two-day workshop provides a foundation in audio electronics and gives sound makers practical tips on creating new instruments. Discussions on sound design and acoustics will be followed by hands-on workshopping.</p>

        <p>No previous electronic or sound experience required.</p>

        <p>Ezer Longinus is a tinkerer and layabout that occasionally dabbles in music. He holds degrees in technology and music from Bard College and New York University. He lives in New York City with one fancy lady and two/three cats and makes electronic projects for a living.</p>

        <p>It’s time to get Unreal! In this weekend course, we will look at how to get started with Unreal Engine 4. The first day is focused on the background of Unreal, what its capabilities are and how it is being used in gaming, virtual reality, video, vfx and more. Day one ends with an interface tour and navigation. On the second day we will import meshes and textures, build materials, and look at the blueprint visual programming system. At the conclusion of the course students will have built a scripted environment to interact with.</p>
        <p>No prior experience is necessary but students are required to bring a laptop with the latest version of Unreal installed. Sign up for an account at www.unrealengine.com and download the software for free.</p>
        <p>Matthew Rader is half of the director duo <a href="http://www.reedandrader.com/">Reed + Rader</a>. With the Unreal Engine, he makes 360 films, gifs and virtual reality experiences set in digital environments.  His work is fun, colorful, wild and lets viewers escape to magical worlds where cats are ridable and dinosaurs dance. He has worked commercially for clients such as Nike, Adidas, Stella McCartney, MTV, MasterCard, Diesel, Snapple, and many more. He lives with his wife and partner Pamela in Brooklyn and they are are Mom and Dad to 5 cats, basketball fans, and farmers on the weekend.</p>

      <h2>Programming Design Systems</h2>
      <p class="time">Month ??-??, 10AM-4PM <span class="price">$???</span></p>

      <div class="class-info">
        <p>This is a class for designers and other visual artists wanting to use code to produce systematic graphic designs. The two-day workshop is structured around the basic elements of graphic design (form, color, typography, grid systems, etc), but participants will use a programming language instead of a traditional design tool to create algorithmic generative designs. Students will learn how to create procedural shapes, generate dynamic color schemes, use randomization to create dynamic designs, and publish it all to the web. The class is taught in <a href="https://p5js.org/">P5.js</a>, a JavaScript library aimed at making coding accessible to artists, designers, educators, and beginners.</p>

        <p>Although this course requires no prior knowledge about JavaScript, students are encouraged to familiarize themselves with P5.js before the class by watching Daniel Shiffman’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA">Foundations of Programming in JavaScript</a> videos on YouTube.</p>

        <p>Programming Design Systems is taught by Rune Madsen, a New York-based artist, designer, and educator who use programming languages to create things with the computer. Rune is currently writing a book called <a href="https://programmingdesignsystems.com">Programming Design Systems</a>, which this class is based on.</p>

      <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
      <p class="large">Below, you'll find answer to common questions related to the classes at Brooklyn Research. If you can't find the answer to your question, feel free to <a href="#">send us an email</a>. We'd love to hear from you.</p>

      <h2>Where are the classes taught?</h2>
      <p>Classes are taught at Brooklyn Research facilities on the 6th Floor of the old Pfizer Building, right in the heart of Brooklyn. The address is <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/raiKtdkdVX32">630 Flushing Avenue</a> but the main entrance is at 28 Tompkins Avenue. The building is easily accessible from the G train (Flushing Ave station) and from the J/M trains (Flushing Ave station).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question container">
      <h2>How long are the classes?</h2>
      <p>Most classes are done as intensive two-day weekend workshops, each day having about 6 hours of class.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question container">
      <h2>Do I need to bring anything?</h2>
      <p>For most classes, laptops will suffice. Each class has its own set of prerequisites listed in the course description, with instructions on how get setup prior to the the start of the workshop. There will be a half hour period prior to the start of class that is highly recommended for anyone unsure if they are set up properly.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question container">
      <h2>How do I pay?</h2>
      <p>We use EventBrite and CourseHorse for handling payments. We can also arrange for on-site payments via credit card or cash half an hour prior to the commencement of class.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question container">
      <h2>Do you take groups?</h2>
      <p>Yes, we certainly do. Please inquire about our payment options and special scheduling for groups.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question container">
      <h2>What is Brooklyn Research?</h2>
      <p>Brooklyn Research is a collective of scientist, artists, futurists and creative technologists. We have been doing commercial and noncommercial projects using our skills and passions for the past 5 years. Recently, we have felt the need to share some of our skills by offering original and experiment oriented workshops. That’s how the idea of Brook;lyn Research classes were born.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question container">
      <h2>Do I need to know programming?</h2>
      <p>It depends on the course. Since most workshops are experimental, exploring the frontiers of a discipline, we require that you have good prior knowledge of the skills and tools discussed in the course. On the other hand, many courses are more oriented to beginners and do not require significant prior coding experience. Look for “Prerequisites” in the course listing for specifics.</p>
