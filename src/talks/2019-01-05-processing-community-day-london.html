      Hello everybody. Before I begin, I would like to say that I am thrilled to
      be a part of this event. I have spent a lot of my time since 2012 teaching
      designers and artists to code, and it is really wonderful to see an event
      like this happen. I am hosting Processing Community Day Copenhagen next
      weekend, so I am hoping to learn a lot of stuff and meet a lot of
      interesting people today. So a big thanks to Joel and the team for
      inviting me here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today I want to talk about my book
      <a href="https://programmingdesignsystems.com">
        Programming Design Systems
      </a>
      as well as my new design practice
      <a href="https://designsystems.international">
        Design Systems International</a
      >.

      But first, let me briefly introduce myself. My name is Rune Madsen, and I
      first of foremost think of myself as a designer who just happens to use
      programming languages to build the kind of products that I care about.
    </p>
    <p>
      My work tends to span a few categories, from the more artistic
      installation and gallery work, to the professional (I used to work at the
      New York Times and as a Creative Director for O’Reilly Media), and I have
      been teaching at New York University since 2012, recently for three
      semesters in Shanghai. But I think the common thread in all of this is the
      merging of design and code.

      I recently co-founded what we call a deeply technical design studio named
      <a href="https://designsystems.international"
        >Design Systems International</a
      >
      with my talented designer friend
      <a href="https://twitter.com/brvmrtn">Martin Bravo</a>, where we work
      hands-on with many of the ideas that I am going to talk about today. I
      will show some of our work at the end also.
    </p>
    <p>
      So that is a little bit about me. Before I begin, I was wondering if we
      can do a quick headcount. How many of you have tried programming before?
      How many of you are students? And how many of you consider yourself
      designers? Thanks a lot, that is always good to know.

      I want to begin by spending some time talking about why I am writing this
      book. From 2012 to 2018, I was teaching at the Interactive
      Telecommunications Program (also called ITP), which is an almost 40-year
      old graduate program at New York University that very much shares the same
      values as the Processing Foundation: To make learning how to program
      accessible to communities that normally do not feel included or think of
      themselves as technical. It is a very diverse graduate program both in age
      groups and in the fields represented, and we are proud that the student
      body is majority women – which is rare for a program focused on
      programming languages and electronics. It is also home to Daniel Shiffman
      from the
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw"
        >Coding Train YouTube channel</a
      >
      who some of you might know.

  <div class="notes">
    <p>
      The way we think about the computer at ITP is quite different than that of
      a traditional engineering program. We teach hard skills, but only because
      our students need them in order to make the kind of creative projects they
      care about: They want to learn P5.js so they can make an animated comic,
      or they want to learn Processing so they can make a generative poster that
      looks different every time you print it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I really like this approach because in this way, programming languages
      become just another tool, a very powerful tool, that enable us to produce
      creative projects. And it gets us away from a world where we separate
      people into technical people who can program the computer on the one side
      and creative people who use their hands on the other side.

      So if you are a painter and you were trained to use a bunch of tools such
      as pigments, brushes, pencils, charcoal, there is no reason why you should
      not also learn how to program and see where this takes you creatively. So
      we really try to lower the barriers to entry for people who normally do
      not consider themselves programmers. This also gives me a chance to show
      my talented friend <a href="https://alexdodge.com/">Alex Dodge</a>, who
      uses lasercut stencils created from generative 3D models to create these
      very graphic, almost graphic design-like, paintings.

    <p>
      However, one thing that has struck me watching students get introduced to
      programming languages is that computers are such a powerful tool that if
      we don not really keep our eyes on it, the computer ends up taking all our
      focus.

  <div class="notes">
    <p>
      If we assume that every creative project is (in simple terms) made up of
      the why (the concept or the content) and the how (the design or the form),
      the creative coding community (or whatever we should call it) tends to
      focus a whole lot on the how.

    <p>
      This means that we spend a lot of time on what a thing looks like and how
      it is made, and very little time asking why it should even exist in the
      world. I began noticing this in my classroom where students would mostly
      comment on the technical sufficiency and visual style of a project, and
      rarely on the concept. I think that is a very natural thing when you are
      introduced to a powerful tool, but it also means that we completely lose
      our connection to fine arts education.

      You can compare this to the new Marvel movies. I wondered for a long time
      why they are unbearable for me to watch. I recently heard Douglas Rushkoff
      say in podcast about another TV-show,
      <em
        >“It went through me like cheese doodles. It is constructed for me to
        keep eating it […], but it actually does not deliver any nutrition”</em
      >. So I wanted to teach a class that could teach code and concept at the
      same time.

      So why focus on graphic design? I think there are many reasons why such a
      book should exist.

      My primary reason is that what graphic design products looked like 25
      years ago is not at all what they are today. We used to live in a world of
      static design products where the word <em>design</em> described most of
      the production process. If you are making a poster, the final product is
      really not that much different from the proposed design.

  </div>
  <div class="notes">
    <p>
      But today most design products are digital and created in software, and
      the visual design is just a small part of what makes up the design
      product.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <div class="img wide-750">

  </div>
  <div class="notes">
    <p>
      What makes a digital design product good is, yes the visual design, but
      also all the things that make it come alive: animations, loading of live
      data, haptic feedback, etc. And the problem is that none of this can be
      designed in a traditional graphic design tool. All of this requires the
      use of programming.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you look at the tools that graphic designers use, it is apparent that
      it is a field built on manual work. Most of the tools in Photoshop,
      Illustrator, or sketch are entirely modelled on manual processes that came
      before the computer: The crop tool, the marquee tool. Even though you are
      doing it with the mouse, it is still a manual drawing process. So we know
      that traditional design tools are very bad at prototyping complex systems.
    </p>

  <div class="img wide-750">

    />
  </div>
  <div class="notes">
    <p>
      So if you insist that designers should only use traditional design tools,
      you end up defining design as a very small part of what it means to make
      something.

      You would think that design schools would understand that this is
      happening and change their curriculum to keep teaching what they are good
      at, but expand their toolset to include new technologies. Unfortunately
      what seems to happen is that many design schools find it too hard to teach
      code, so they double down on this idea that designers should be creative
      people who come up with ideas, and then more technical people should
      implement them. I think that is really unfortunate because it leaves us
      with an educational system where the design schools teach conceptual
      thinking but in a frame of mind where the designer is someone who makes
      posters and book covers, and technical schools that teach code but not
      conceptual thinking. I am off course generalising here, because there are
      many amazing art+technology schools, but I do think that a common problem
      here is that there is no foundational book that thinks about graphic
      design (shape, color, typography, layout, etc) in terms of programming
      languages.

    <p>
      And that is really fristrating because the history of graphic design is
      full of books applying systems and rules to the design process. Even
      before the computer, designers were using algorithms to help them design
      better, so I find it particularly odd that the field of graphic design has
      not embraced these new tools.

      … but p5.js. The focus is on the <em>why?</em>, but I use code as a way of
      showing the <em>how?</em>. And I have finally come to a point where I have
      written enough chapters that I can talk about them in detail, so I would
      like to run through each part of the book and explain the ideas.

      The book starts with an introduction and foreword titled
      <em>What is a Design System?</em>, to help readers understand this cryptic
      word that has become so trendy over the last couple of years. If you take
      anything away from my book, it is that designers should start thinking in
      what the American computer scientist Donald Knuth calls meta-design.

      <em>Reads quote</em>. This idea that instead of just drawing something,
      designers should explain to a computer, in code, how to draw it, is really
      powerful. The way I demonstrate this idea in my book is with a simple
      example.

      Imagine a poster (to the left) designed by a famous graphic designer, in
      this case Paul Rand. This is designed entirely by hand, possibly in an
      early version of Photoshop or Quark Express. But even though this poster
      was done by hand, there is a very clear systematic structure to it: Repeat
      green hearts in a grid across the page with equal spacing between them.
      Turn one heart red, and replace one heart with a title. We can take that
      idea and implement it in p5.js, shown to the right. As you can see, there
      is not much of a difference between the two versions.

    />
  </div>
  <div class="notes">
    <p>
      However, once you have implemented it in p5.js, you can easily try out
      variations of the same idea: What if we had less rows and larger hearts?
      What if it was really dense spacing? Every iteration of this would take
      equally long to do by hand, but with the random function in p5.js, you can
      have a different poster whenever you run your code. I think that is such a
      powerful idea: It is not only that designers should use code to build
      digital products, it is also that designers can write these small personal
      tools that allows them to explore an idea quickly.

      I also trace these ideas of design systems back through history, from
      Graphics Standards Manuals from the 1970’s to today’s design systems such
      as Google’s Material Design and more interesting dynamic branding
      projects.

      The first part of the book is devoted to the most fundamental thing is
      graphic design: Using shapes to convey meaning. There are a number of

      I try as much as possible to show work from my students. Here it is my now
      famous <em>Ice Cream Cone</em> exercise, which is in the book too, where
      students have to draw an ice cream cone in black and white using only an
      ellipse, rectangle, and triangle once in their code. So if they want more
      than three shapes, they have to use for-loops to achieve it. One thing
      that I found early on is that graphic design books are often very
      confusing to students, because they introduce a huge set of techniques or
      categories, which makes the students think that learning to be a good
      designer is about memorising all these categories that the author made up.
      So I start my book very constrained –in the beginning using only black and
      white and a few shapes– and make readers learn how to use these before
      moving on to something more complicated.

      But then slowly I introduce more concepts, such as drawing custom shapes

      Every chapter of my book has an exercise so the reader can practice what
      is taught in the chapter. This is the <em>Wet and Sharp</em> assignment,

      And then finally, as the basic ideas are understood, we start jumping into
      the really fun stuff: How can you take advantage of the fact that we are
      using a programming language to create shapes that would take a long time
      to draw by hand. So we talk about for-loops and ...

      The idea here is that most of us think in color in terms of this thing,
      the color picker, which is actually a horrible tool for visualizing the
      color spectrum. To make color combinations that work, you have to think
      about the relationship between colors, and to know this relationship, you
      have to think about the color spectrum as a 3D model.

      So the first chapter is dedicated to a history of color theory, how
      scientists and artists have argued about the nature of color, and what the
      current science tell us about concepts like color harmony – which I
      learned does not exist as an objective measure.

      It is too complicated to explain here in detail, but the important thing
      is how you can stretch the color spectrum into all these different shapes,
      and some of these are very helpful if you are trying to do specific things
      in code.

      The chapter <em>Perceptually Uniform Color Spaces</em> explains how the
      human eye does not perceive the wavelengths of a color linearly, so if you
      want to draw a gradient that looks like it changes in a linear
      progression, you have to use what is called a perceptually uniform color
      space.

      This example shows a fade between two colors with even distance between
      each color value in a normal color space (top) and a perceptually uniform
      color space (bottom). This is important to know e.g. if you are designing
      data visualizations so you are not lying with your color values.

      I think the most important color chapter is this one, which is on color
      combination. I did a lot of research around how artists and designers have
      thought about color combination, and I found that the way many design
      books talk about color schemes are actually really wrong.

      Many books will show you diagrams such as these, where a shape is laid on
      top of the color wheel to pick certain colors. But the problem is again
      that it ss treating the color spectrum as a flat space that only changes
      in hue, ignoring the two other dimensions of color: saturation and
      brightness.

    <p>
      So my chapter on color combination talks about each dimension of color
      separately, starting out with brightness or lightness and how to create
      contrast in your designs by manipulating color values. Here it is
      brightness.

      I then move on to saturation, or color purity, which can be used to create
      very dull or vivid compositions. Again, everything is explained in p5.js

      So that is what is in the book. Most of this is material I have tested on
      students in my classroom over the years. I figured it would be fun to show
      you some student projects, because I think it shows you just what happens
      when you introduce programming languages in a design class: I have noticed
      that students not only get better ideas, but they also start thinking in a
      different way when introduced to p5.js. Here are a few examples, all

      I think the interesting thing about these projects - and I have hundreds
      of these to show - is that you would rarely come up with these ideas if I
      did not teach the class in code. So I think it is a good example of how
      you can be focused on the conceptual part while exploring interesting
      code-based designs.

      But we also specialise in more interesting branding projects. CCC is a new

      rooms, a cafe, and a large ter­race. Set to open in San­ti­ago in early
      2019, the cen­ter is restor­ing a beau­ti­ful old town­house to fit this

      We worked with CCC to cre­ate a dy­namic iden­tity sys­tem for the cen­ter

      and on the web. The iden­tity con­sist of three vari­ables that can be

      with carved C’s in­spired by the graphic pat­terns in the floor tiles, a

      Given the wealth of ma­te­ri­als that will be needed for the cen­ter, we
      de­vel­oped a web ap­pli­ca­tion that can be used by the CCC team to
      cre­ate new grid pat­terns as a start­ing point for event posters or other
      com­mu­ni­ca­tions ma­te­r­ial. The grid gen­er­a­tor is writ­ten in
      Re­act.js.

      We also worked on the new visual identity for MIT Libraries, cre­ated by
      Michael Beirut and Aron Fay at Pentagram Design. We worked as tech­ni­cal
      part­ners with Pen­ta­gram on the pro­ject to cre­ate a cus­tom de­sign
      tool that can be used to gen­er­ate end­less vari­a­tions of the logo.
      Rather than de­liv­er­ing a sta­tic set of logo files, this gen­er­a­tor
      soft­ware can be used to gen­er­ate new lo­gos whether for event posters,
      sig­nage, or so­cial me­dia. The logo soft­ware is writ­ten in the
      Pro­cess­ing pro­gram­ming lan­guage, which was de­vel­oped at the MIT
      Me­dia Lab by alumni Ben Fry and Casey Reas. A tool­bar in the in­ter­face
      al­lows the user to change the word­mark, color, stroke set­tings, and
      back­ground of the logo, and ex­port the logo as ei­ther a sta­tic im­age
      or an­i­mated video se­quence. It is li­censed un­der the MIT open source
      li­cense.

      Finally, since this is Processing Community Day, I want to say that if you
      are interested in graphic design an code, I wrote another JavaScript
      library called Rune.js that generates vector files. So if you want to do
      generate branding for both web and print, this might come in handy.
