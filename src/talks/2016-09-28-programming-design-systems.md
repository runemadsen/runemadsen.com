excerpt: |
  Whether we like it or not, a designer is now a creator of digital systems, and this begs the question Should design and engineering be two distinct fields? In this talk, Rune Madsen will present the main thesis from his upcoming book “Programming Design Systems”, and explain why it’s increasingly difficult to rely on static design tools, why designers must accept new tools to avoid irrelevancy, and what happens when we educate designers to use a programming language as their tool of choice.

Whether we like it or not, a designer is now a creator of digital systems, and
this begs the question: Should design and engineering be two distinct fields? In
this talk, Rune Madsen will present the main thesis from his upcoming book
“Programming Design Systems”, and explain why it’s increasingly difficult to
rely on static design tools, why designers must accept new tools to avoid
irrelevancy, and what happens when we educate designers to use a programming
language as their tool of choice.
