During the last couple of years I have seen myself move in quite a few different
directions. In 2009 I found myself updating numerous sites, depending on which
of these areas I was working on. For my company I updated my portfolio on these
pages. When I did PHP development, most of it was on forums or on
[my joomla blog](http://www.youcanjoomla.com). When I recorded new music I
started a new website for every project.

In December 2009 I decided to gather all these websites in one, and this is the
outcome. Because I'm trying to cover all of my interests in one single blog, it
may seem confusing to some, though I hope it's not mostly the case. Some posts
will be strickly about code, some will be about my thoughts on graphic design
and interaction.

I know there's places on the website that doesn't quite look as they should, but
I'm very much caught up in grad. school, but feel free to comment anything you
find interesting, wrong or irritating.
