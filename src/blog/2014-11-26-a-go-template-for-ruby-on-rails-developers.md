I have been interested in Go for a while. The benefits are obvious: It’s crazy
fast, optimized for concurrency, and the standalone binaries are wonderful for
deployments. My Rails app takes about 18 seconds just to come to life, so the
speed alone is a huge win for me.

However, getting started with Go is not easy. Say what you want about Ruby on
Rails, but it’s hard to find a framework that makes is so easy to get started.
Moving to Go feels a bit like coding a new application in Rack: The libraries
are there, but you have to integrate everything by yourself. Being closer to the
metal is incredible, but ease of use is important too. The popularity of
frameworks like Martini is a testament to that.

To contribute a little bit, I’ve been working on a template for Go applications,
inspired by some of the concepts from Rails. It has folders for models, views
and controllers (models, templates and routes in Go speak). It ships with sane
defaults for databases. It has an asset pipeline. It has route and model tests.
It _just works_ on Heroku.

It is my hope that this template can serve as reference for developers starting
out with Go. It might very well be that you will end up using only a few things
from the template, but I think it's beneficial to demonstrate all of these
concepts in the same application code.

The code itself is heavily commented, and all folders have a README file for
clarification. Pull requests are more than welcome, and so is questions and
comments on Twitter ([@runemadsen](https://www.twitter.com/runemadsen)).
