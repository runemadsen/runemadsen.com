I just released 4 new tracks with my band _Silence is a Virus_. The tracks can
be streamed for free via
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Silence-Is-A-Virus/113178405360214">Facebook</a>,
or downloaded for free via
<a href="http://www.silenceisavirus.com">www.silenceisavirus.com</a>. The genre
is a combination of post rock and alternative metal, something between Sigur Ros
and Deftones. You are free to distribute the tracks as much as you like, and if
you enjoy listening to them, please join our page on
