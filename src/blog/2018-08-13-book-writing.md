I am currently in the process of writing a book, called Programming Design
Systems, which is the result of my last five years of teaching. It is a free
digital book that teaches a practical introduction to the new foundations of
graphic design, and it is
[available for free online](https://programmingdesignsystems.com/). I hope that
you will subscribe to the newsletter to follow along as I continue to post new
chapters.
