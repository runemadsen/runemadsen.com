This week I'll be showing 27 graphic prints as a part of the
<a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/residentsshow/">Center for the Recently Possible</a>
exhibit. "Tiny Artists" is a series of small computer programs that print
graphic posters according to their individual style, taste, and current mood.
Each program is born with a short lifespan and can only create a limited number
of works. A program will then delete itself and leave no digital trace of itself
or its creations. The printed graphics are the only originals. "Tiny Artists" is
a simulation of the commissioning of artists, a story of life and death in
software, and a comment on the originality of art in the digital world.
