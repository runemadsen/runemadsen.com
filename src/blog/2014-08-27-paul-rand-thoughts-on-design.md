Continuing down the path of documenting my design book collection, this next
book is a special one for me. I spent about 5 years looking for a decent version
of it, and ended up finding two versions in 2013: The first edition hardcover
from 1947 (right), and the paperback reprint from 1970 (left).

_Thoughts on Design_ was written by the 33 year old Paul Rand, as he was
establishing his career in the advertising arts. It is almost entirely in black
and white, and showcases some of his most famous early works, like the
_Direction_ magazine covers and _Coronet_ ads.

Even though the short texts touch mostly on advertising related subjects (_The
Symbol in Advertising_, _Reader participation_, etc), they hold a great deal of
the general design theory that he is known for (and that fills many of his later
books).

It's still mind-boggling to me that this book was written in 1947, at a time
where advertising art was dominated by
[pastel colors and handwritten quotations](https://www.google.com/search?q=advertising+1940%27s&espv=2&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=LZD-U6m-Gca7ogSCyIGoBg&ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ&biw=1393&bih=802).
I often have to remind myself that one of my favorite works of Paul Rand â€“ the
poster to the movie
[_No Way Out (1950)_](http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140108215153/scratchpad/images/e/ee/1950_-_No_Way_Out_Movie_Poster.jpg),
was created just a couple of years after World War 2. There's obivously a lot
more to say about Rand, and I'll try to get around to it when documenting his
later books.
