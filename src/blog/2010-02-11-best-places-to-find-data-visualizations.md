I've found that good data visualizations are hard to find. Even the best sites
have post after post showing ugly bubble diagrams with Twitter connections. So
here's my list of some of the best sources for great data visualizations I've
stumbled upon in 2009:

<a href="http://infosthetics.com/">http://infosthetics.com/</a> Great site if
you know where to look. Go back in the archives to find beautiful work.

<a href="http://flowingdata.com">http://flowingdata.com</a> Not as good as
infosthetics and also a much smaller site.

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">http://www.nytimes.com/</a> Sounds weird, but
their graphic department leaded by Steve Duenes come up with great, refined
visuals.

<a href="http://www.earlboykins.blogspot.com/">http://www.earlboykins.blogspot.com/</a>
Minimalist graphs visualizing performances or everyday experiences.

<a href="http://manyeyes.alphaworks.ibm.com/manyeyes/">http://manyeyes.alphaworks.ibm.com/manyeyes/</a>
Not my favourite. Look for great data mashups, not great graphics.

<a href="http://www.datamasher.org/">http://www.datamasher.org/</a> Same with
this one.

And some greats books:

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Maeda-Media-John/dp/0789305259">Maeda @ Media</a>
Not the best book about creative coding, but a nice look into the earlier works
of John Maeda.

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Creative-Code-Computation-John-Maeda/dp/0500285179">Creative
Code</a> The better one by John Maeda.

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fresh-Dialogue-Nine-Visible-Revealed/dp/1568988168">Graphic
Data Revealed</a> A really good book. Short and precise.

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Data-Flow-Visualising-Information-Graphic/dp/3899552172">Data
Flow</a> A truly beautiful book about modern data visualization. 50 percent of
the content is great, which is much, much higher than all other stuff around.
