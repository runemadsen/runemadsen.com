I'm just finally getting around to updating my website with new work. Here's a
photo of my newest gallery showing of my "Tiny Artists" series. These software
programs and resulting posters investigate color theory, and how far you can
come in creating software that creates beautiful themes without too many
restrictions in the code.

These prints were shown as a part of the Everything is Temp gallery exhibition
at the [TEMP Art Space](http://tempartspace.com/) in Tribeca, Manhattan. You can
[read more about the project](/work/tiny-artists-456) on the work page.
