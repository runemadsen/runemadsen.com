It's been so long since I've posted anything on the blog. My schedule has been
packed with graduating from ITP, starting work as an interactive developer at
the New York Times, and working at ITP as a resident researcher.

I thought I'd post these slides from a workshop I gave today about how to think
about design in digital media. I'm hoping to expand them into a series of
tutorials (hopefully on my re-designed website after Christmas), but until now
this will have to do.

You can

the slides as a PDF</a> here.
