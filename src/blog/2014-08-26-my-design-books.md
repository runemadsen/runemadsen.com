In a conversation yesterday where I complained about not being able to find time
to write about all of the design books I own,
[Greg Borenstein](http://gregborenstein.com/) suggested that I should start
blogging about them. That seemed like a good idea, so I'm going to try to
accumulate a small catalog of my books by writing at least a post a week,
posting pictures and short descriptions about the collection that has taken me
many years to assemble.

As I cannot live without constraints, I'm going to limit every post to 3
pictures and 3 smaller paragraphs. This picture shows about 1/10 of my books, so
there's some way to go.
