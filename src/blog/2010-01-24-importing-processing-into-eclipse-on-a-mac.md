Lately I've been doing a lot of Processing and it's pretty clear the the
Processing IDE doesn't compare to powerful applications like Eclipse. There's an
<a target="_blank" href="http://processing.org/learning/tutorials/eclipse/">excellent
tutorial</a> on processing.org on how to import the core.jar Processing library
into your Eclipse Java project. I tried the tutorial, but couldn't figure out
how to import the core.jar - because when trying to import the filesystem, I
couldn't expand the Processing applications folder. Because OSX treats
applications like an encapsulated file, it's not possible to browse into the
Processing folder and select the library. In Finder it's possible to right-click
and select "Show Package Contents", but you cannot do this from inside the
Eclipse dialog. This is how you solve the problem:

1. Select your Applications folder and press "OK"<br />

2. Manually add "/Processing" in the textfield.<br />

3. Click "Browse". Now you will see the package contents of the Processing
   applications folder<br />

4. Navigate to the core.jar file and import it.<br />
