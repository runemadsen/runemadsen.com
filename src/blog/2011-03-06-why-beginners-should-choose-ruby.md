I've rarely been as excited about anything related to web development as when
making the switch to Ruby a couple of years ago. But it was when my fellow
student from [ITP](http://www.itp.nyu.edu),
[Greg Borenstein](http://urbanhonking.com/ideasfordozens) introduced me to
[Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) that I first noticed how perfect an
environment Ruby is for web dev beginners.

In this post I will try to illustrate why I think Ruby and Sinatra should be the
preferred environment for students who have never programmed before - and why it
beats PHP any time.

**The Ruby syntax**

One of the strongest things about Ruby is the language syntax. In Ruby there are
no messy variable symbols ($), no semi-colons (;), and the use of curly brackets
({}) and parenthesis () is often optional. This means shorter, readable code.
The language structure in Ruby is as close to a written language structure as
possible.

In the following few examples I'll try to compare the readability between Ruby
and PHP. First is an example of creating an associative array in both languages:

<div class="wide-750">
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/2075819.js?file=associative.rb"> </script>
</div>

The last evaluated value in a Ruby function is always used as the return value.
Notice the optional parenthesis in the Ruby function call.

<div class="wide-750">
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/2076465.js"> </script>
</div>

One of the most important things about Ruby is that it's a pure object oriented
language, which means that everything is an object (including numbers and string
literals). Take the following code that outputs "Hello" 10 times, using the
'times' function of the Number class. Is that not the most read-able for-loop
you have ever seen?

<div class="wide-750">
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/2076498.js"> </script>
</div>

There is a clean and defined place for every Ruby function, and this makes the
life of the beginner much easier. The exact opposite is true for PHP, where you
have to search through odd global functions to perform standard routines. As an
example, in PHP you use sizeof() to count the size of an array, but strlen() to
count the size of a string. In Ruby it's a different story:

<div class="wide-750">
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/2076531.js"> </script>
</div>

This leads me to another important fact about Ruby: It's so well structured that
your guess if often enough to find the correct function call of an object. I
love this next one. Ruby functions that return boolean values have a question
mark at the end:

<div class="wide-750">
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/2076544.js"> </script>
</div>

**Class properties and symbols** You remember all that time you've spent
scrolling up and down in your PHP classes to define or edit class properties and
constants, because they need to be defined at the top of the class, but used
from within your functions? Ruby gets rid of all this by allowing class
properties (using @) and constants (called symbols, using :) to be declared on
the fly. The following code examples both do the same thing: create an
associative array as a class property and use a constant as a key and a string
as a value. PHP uses 10 lines of code to do this. Ruby uses 5. Which example do
you think is the easiest to understand for a beginner?

<div class="wide-750">  
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/2076561.js"> </script>
</div>

**The Ruby Gem system**

One of the areas where PHP really fails is with libraries. Even though people
have been using PHP for many years, I've never seen a student use a PHP library
in my life. This is a problem with the language framework: To use a PHP library
you have to download it, unzip it, copy it to your server root and include it in
your script. Kind of a hassle. But what happens when the library gets updated?
Then you have to do it all over again.

One of the most powerful things about Ruby is the Gem system. It's a small
program that comes with Ruby that can download, update or delete Ruby libraries
from a central repository. You can also create your own online repository if you
want to. Because Ruby has a central place for all libraries this means that the
beginner has easy access to well-documented and well-maintained Ruby libraries
(called gems).

One of these gems is the Bundler gem, which helps you automatically install the
gems you need for your project. Create a simple file in your project folder that
lists all the gems your project needs. Run a single command in terminal, "bundle
install" , and all your gems will install on the machine. Imagine how easy it is
to update libraries in a project: update the Gemfile and run the command again.
Deploying to a server that has no Ruby gems installed? No problem. Run "bundle
install" after uploading your project files and you're ready to go.

<div class="wide-750">
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/2076568.js"> </script>
</div>

Ruby Gem makes the life of a beginner so much easier, as they almost never have
to build complicated functionality by themselves. If someone has done it before,
it's probably accessible as a gem. Want to build a Twitter application that
saves all of your tweets as PDF's? No problem. Using the Prawn and Twitter gem
this is possible with only 10 lines of code.

**Databases and ORM's**

I have not written a single line of SQL code since I started developing in Ruby.
This is because there are tons of gems that take care of the database calls for
you, the so-called Object Relational Mappers. All programmers know the problem:
you work and think in object oriented patterns, but still you need to write SQL
calls to fill your models. This is not so much a problem when you have single
model to fill, but what if your project demands class associations (my blog post
has many comments), or even polymorphic associations (my blog post has many
comments. Comments can have nested comments)? There is simply no way a beginner
can wrap his head around this easily.

ORM's exist as a layer between the code and the database, providing excellent
abstraction for the beginner. In other words, it allows you to stay in the
object-oriented world. As an example, let's look at how you would create a blog
using [Datamapper](http://datamapper.org), a perfect ORM fit for your Sinatra
application. First you define your models and then run the command
"auto_migrate!" to create the tables in your database.

<div class="wide-750">
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/2076588.js"> </script>
</div>

Then you can save data from Ruby to the database. Notice how
my_post.comments.create automatically creates and saves a comment belonging to
my_post:

<div class="wide-750">
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/2076667.js"> </script>
</div>

And you can show the data on your website. Notice how all the comments
automatically gets build in the comments array of the Post objects:

<div class="wide-750">
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/2076677.js"> </script>
</div>

And that's basically it. Using ORM's the beginner don't have to worry about SQL
calls, as DataMapper will take care of all the querying.

**IRB**

Ruby comes with an interactive console, which allows you to type code and get
the results immediately. For the beginner this can be an excellent way of
testing code without having to worry about creating Ruby files or classes. The
interactive console is opened by typing "irb" into a terminal window:

<div class="wide-750">
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/2076685.js"> </script>
</div>

**Sinatra**

Sinatra is a micro-framework perfectly suited for a beginner. You can write a
Sinatra application in one single file or use view files to separate code and
formatting. In Sinatra you write a function for every route in your website,
also specifying the type of HTTP request. This is an excellent approach for
newcomers, as it learns the beginner the basic concepts of HTTP requests and
routes. The following is a simple Sinatra application specifying 3 routes
available for GET requests. Notice the last route. It allows visitors to visit
e.g. /greeting/rune, and Sinatra automatically parses the value of :yourname
into an associative array and makes it available in the function.

<div class="wide-750">
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/2076708.js"> </script>
</div>

Another great thing about Sinatra is how easy it is to separate the controller
code from the view. This is standard practice for any web project, and with
Sinatra it is as easy as creating a 'views' folder, create the views, and render
them with one line of code. All class properties will be available in the
rendered view, as shown in this simple greeting application:

<div class="wide-750">
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/2076718.js"> </script>
</div>

With Sinatra it's ridiculously easy to build your own API, using the GET, POST,
PUT, DELETE functions. This example is taken directly from the
[Sinatra Book](http://sinatra-book.gittr.com):

<div class="wide-750">
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/2076734.js"> </script>
</div>

**Heroku**

No programming language is worth anything without easy deployment, and this is
where PHP has been successful. With PHP you can upload your files to a server
via FTP and the site is online immediately. However this approach quickly
becomes a problem when working with bigger projects. Either you choose to edit
your PHP-files on your local computer and upload them to the server manually via
your FTP client, or you choose to edit the files directly on the server. I've
seen students doing both things, and in the end it's a frustrating way of
working. If you edit your files on your local computer, you have no idea what
files you actually changed, and you often have to upload the entire project
again. This is not a great approach if you're building your site using Drupal
that ships with +8000 files. Editing the files directly on the server is not a
better alternative, as your local copy gets out of sync, and the live site will
crash if you make any coding mistakes.

(http://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a> is a rock-solid Ruby platform that provides
free hosting for your Ruby site. Heroku ships with a heroku gem, which allows
you to create a domain and deploy your files from your local computer. The
following commands will install the Heroku gem and create your personal web
space on [http://rune.heroku.com](http://rune.heroku.com):

<div class="wide-750">
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/2076763.js"> </script>
</div>

Heroku integrates with the version control system Git, which means that you can
upload your code using one simple command. This command will only upload your
changes since last push, and you will never find yourself looking for updated
files in your FTP client ever again.

<div class="wide-750">
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/2076768.js"> </script>
</div>

Using Heroku does require the beginner to learn the basic concepts of Git. This
can be challenging for a beginner who has never used the command line before.
Fortunately there is a number of great GUI's like
[Git Tower](http://www.git-tower.com/) that provides a clean interface for the
beginner. However I'm a big supporter of learning basic command line usage to
beginners. Git can basically be operated using very few commands:

<div class="wide-750">
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/2076775.js"> </script>
</div>

**Conclusion**

I feel strongly about Sinatra as the perfect tool for teaching web development,
especially in places where non-programmers need to learn to sketch out
prototypes fast. On top of that, students who learn Sinatra can jump to Rails
when building larger-scale applications. Almost everything about the
Ruby/Sinatra combination seems like a perfect match for the web dev beginner:
The Ruby syntax, excellent documentation, clear separation of code and views,
great ORM's and an easy and understandable introduction to HTTP requests through
the Sinatra API. On top of that comes easy deployment with Heroku.

Just like the professional web development firms have moved away from PHP, I
think it's time for educational institutions to take the same approach. The
reasons for using Ruby instead of PHP are simply too many.

Much of this is directly inspired by discussions with
[Greg Borenstein](http://urbanhonking.com/ideasfordozens) around the use of Ruby
and Sinatra at [ITP](http://www.itp.nyu.edu).
