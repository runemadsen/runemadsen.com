_Design, Form, and Chaos_ was one of Paul Rand's later books, published three
years before his death in 1996. The book focuses on seven of his most famous
logo designs (_NeXT_, _IBM_, _IDEO_, etc), and is especially interesting because
the original design portfolios – the pamphlets delivered to the clients – are
printed unedited along with the logo examples.

The _IBM_ logo presentation shows the logo before and after Rand's redesign, as
he explains how the stripes were inspired by the horizontal lines sometimes
printed on legal documents to discourage counterfeiting.

I especially enjoy the presentation about the _NeXT_ logo, where Rand presents
the precursors to the final logo, and explain why they didn't fulfill the design
goal. Seeing the logo come to life through a number of design steps is a nice
peek behind the curtain of his own design process, as well as a great reference
to any junior designer.

The story about the design of the _NeXT_ logo is well-known, but it's a good
one: Steve Jobs
[apparently asked](http://kottke.org/10/04/1993-steve-jobs-inverview-about-paul-rand)
Rand to _"come up with a few options"_ for a logo, whereafter Rand replied:

> No. I will solve your problem for you. And you will pay me. And you don’t have
> to use the solution. If you want options, go talk to other people. But I’ll
> solve your problem for you the best way I know how. And you use it or not.
> That’s up to you. You’re the client. But you pay me."

Rand later said that Jobs' first words after seeing the _NeXT_ logo were _"can I
hug you?_. I own the first edition hardcover from 1993.
