_From Lascaux to Brooklyn_ was published in 1996, the year Paul Rand passed
away. Here's a short snippet from the jacket description:

> In this lively and visually arresting book, Rand awakens readers to the
> lessons of the cave paintings of Lascaux – that art is an intuitive,
> autonomous, and timeless activity – and he shows how this is conveyed in works
> of art [...] all of which are aestheticially pleasing no matter what their
> era, place, purpose, style or genre.

The format of the book is like most of his other books: Short texts with lots of
examples of his own work.

I enjoy Rand's work because it balances a very freehand and artistic process
with a more systematic and functional design approach. He found freedom within
his own constraints in a way that very few designers has managed to do, and even
though his own work has a very specific style, this book – with its thoughts on
design principles as a foundation for all art forms – can be an inspiration to
anyone looking to apply a system to their own artistic process.
