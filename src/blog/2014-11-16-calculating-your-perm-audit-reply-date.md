Like many other foreigners in the US, I've been stuck in the greencard
application process since early 2013. The frustrations over that process and its
toll on my family is a story for another time. Long story short, our greencard
application was randomly audited, and we've now been stuck waiting for a reply
for 513 days and counting.

The only info you can find about the PERM audit process is that it will take
9-14 months. This weekend, I wanted to see if I couldn't find a better estimate
for this, and it was very easy.

Using data from the
[Trackitt PERM tracker](http://www.trackitt.com/usa-immigration-trackers/atlanta-perm),
I found the last 6 resolved PERM audit cases, and looked at the total processing
time for each audit. The ranges were close (573-584 days) with an average of 578
days. Using my own priority date, it was super easy to throw together a small
Ruby countdown script.

It seems like I have at least 65 days more of waiting, with an estimated reply
date of January 20th 2015. It's very simple stuff, but having a concrete date
feels really good.
