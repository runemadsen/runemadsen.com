The game I did with a couple friends, People Watching Plus, have been accepted
into the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.comeoutandplay.org/">Come Out And
Play</a> festival 2010. If you're in New York June 5th, stop by the Old Stone
House at 1pm and play test a fun and not so competitive game. Read more about
the rules and location on the
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.comeoutandplay.org/2010_peoplewatchingplus.php">Come
Out And Play festivals</a> website.
